☆☆☆ GREETINGS, and MAY IT PLEASE THE FORUM:
Backdrop: Charlotte, North Carolina in the
2020's: a city glistening with bright
skyscrapers as a vision of the New South, with
poverty and crime closely lurking. Two factions
arise: 

BIGLAW, a wealthy shadow organization that
protects only the wealthy at the expense of
the people. And SOLO: fighting alone to defend
the rights of the people from ever increasing
government and corporate overreach. Our story
unfolds here: ☆☆☆


OUR HERO:

A criminal defense attorney by day;
By night: a marauder of legal tools, 
traversing the digital seas toward the ideals 
we once were promised as birthright (our only 
guide being the second star to the right,
then straight on 'till morning). 

HIS MISSIOM:

Efforts to re-engineer the profession, 
hijacking through time the rigid methods 
and time shackeled traditions baked so 
deeply into the culture of my colleagues, 
our compass has become acquisition of 
knowledge. We are our own professors. 
 
Gaze, and lay thine eyes upon that which 
man has created. 

STRATEGY:

Automation. Streamling. 
Eliminating redundencies. 
Customization. Solutions for one.

With each advance we sail closer to that 
always moving target: leveling the field 
between SOLO (trusted agents of the people;
working by backlit keyboard) in his crusades
against BIGLAW (sworn enemies, safe high above
in their walled castles).
